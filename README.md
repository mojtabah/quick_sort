# quick_sort
A basic test for a self-written quick-sort program written in Python compared to a nested-for loop. 
It also compares these to the built-in Python sort.

It generates a list of user-specified size containing randomly generated integers within a user-specified range.
It then sorts the list using a nested-for loop sort, my personal quick sort, and the built-in Python sort.
The speeds are all clocked and printed to user output. The unsorted and sorted lists are printed to a generatedLists.txt file.
